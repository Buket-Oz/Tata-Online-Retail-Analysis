## **Assumptions & Caveats**  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Unspecified Country Data** ‚Äì Some transactions had `"Unspecified"` locations but **valid revenue data**, so they were **retained** to prevent revenue loss.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing Customer IDs** ‚Äì Some transactions lacked **Customer IDs** (guest checkouts or missing data) but were included in revenue calculations.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Exclusion of Returns & Negative Transactions** ‚Äì **All negative quantities or zero-priced transactions were removed** to ensure accurate revenue insights.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Non-Product Transactions Removed** ‚Äì Some descriptions such as `"POSTAGE"`, `"FEE"`, `"ADJUST"`, `"MANUAL"`, `"DOTCOM"`, `"CARRIAGE"`, `"REFUND"`, and `"DEBT"` did not represent actual product sales and were removed.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Outlier Removal for Data Accuracy** ‚Äì Extremely high values in **Unit Price and Quantity** (above the 99th percentile) were removed to eliminate **potential data entry errors** or **unrealistic transactions** that could skew the analysis.
